## Overview

HealthPredict is an innovative disease prediction system that combines machine learning algorithms with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). Users can input symptoms, and the system predicts possible diseases using Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes models.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive GUI for easy interaction.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes for accurate predictions.
- **Symptom-Based Analysis:** Predicts diseases based on user-input symptoms.
